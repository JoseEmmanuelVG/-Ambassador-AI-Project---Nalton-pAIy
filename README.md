# -Ambassador-AI-Project---Nalton-pAIy

**NALTON_WALLET (Web Application NOW)**
Utilizes technologies like XRPL (XRP Ledger), Smart Contracts, XRPL APIs, OpenAI APIs, and more.
Includes components such as transaction summary, wallet browser (using basic AI for transaction detection), local wallet modals, and more.
Backed by a Node.js backend with MongoDB for storing encrypted XRPL testnet account information.
Implements features for saving addresses and keys, making transactions through text input, viewing transaction history, and generating images for transactions. Challenges we ran into

# **Azure Implementation**
We plan to implement wallet connectivity for XRPL and Metamask devnet, as well as different wallet connect wallets to make the application a multichain site. In order to increase the security and not need to save the sensitivity aaccount information, or use a better ways to save it The future of Nalton Paiy involves further refining the application, expanding its compatibility with different wallet connectors, and exploring integration with the Ripple CBDC Innovate Payment Service and international banking networks. The team also plans to enhance security, improve user experience, and potentially migrate to a more comprehensive cloud solution like Azure Cloud:

- Use key vault to save the secrets keys
- Use Azure Cosmos Db to save the images and the same service or another focus to save the accounts if it is necesary
- Use the Azure open AI services to get a full Azure Cloud connection Apis
